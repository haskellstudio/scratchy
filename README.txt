If you're using Racket v5.1.3.9 or later, use

 raco pkg install scratchy

to download and install the "scratchy" package and collection.


For earlier versions, install this directory as a Racket collection
"scratchy", perhaps by running

 raco link scratchy
 raco setup scratchy scribblings/main

in the directory directory containing this "README.txt" (as opposed to
the parent directory of this one).
